# Polymorphism means "many forms". It refers to the ability of an entity (like a function or object) 
# to perform different actions based on the context.
# Technically, in Python, polymorphism allows same method, function or operator to behave differently 
# depending on object it is working with. This makes code more flexible and reusable.
