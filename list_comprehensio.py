# list comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python.
# it consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause,
# and can also include if clauses to filter items.

# syntax 
# [expression for item in iterable if condition]


# Using list comprehension
# squares = [i * i for i in range(1, 6)]
# print(squares)  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# for i in range(1, 6):
#     print(i) 


print([i for i in range(1, 6)])
